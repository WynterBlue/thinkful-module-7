# Hello, distant world
I _want_ to drink tea **today**.

But, I can't go to Dunkin yet.

```js
function hello(name, drink) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + ", would you like some " + drink + "?")
}
```

1. Go out
2. Drive to Dunkin
3. Buy my tea
4. ???
5. Profit

Drinks I like:
- Mocha Latte
- Mocha Matcha Iced Tea
- Bubble Tea
- Water
